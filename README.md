### Technical Architecture

**Backend Processing System**
The Spring Boot backend serves as the core ETL engine, featuring:
- **Robust CSV Parsing**: Utilizes OpenCSV library for reliable data extraction with support for various CSV formats and delimiters
- **Data Transformation Pipeline**: Structured processing flow that converts raw CSV data into normalized JSON format
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Comprehensive validation system that identifies and reports data inconsistencies
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle files of varying sizes with optimized memory usage

**Frontend Data Interface**
The React.js frontend provides:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular design with specialized components for file upload, data display, column selection, and processing options
- **State Management**: Efficient data flow and state handling for seamless user interactions
- **Responsive UI Components**: Custom-built components optimized for data manipulation tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic content rendering that responds instantly to user actions

### Data Processing Capabilities

**File Upload & Validation**
- Supports standard CSV file formats with automatic format detection
- Validates file integrity before processing to prevent errors
- Provides immediate feedback on file compatibility and structure

**Data Structure Analysis**
- Automatically identifies column types and data patterns
- Detects header rows and data boundaries
- Analyzes data quality and completeness

**Transformation & Display**
- Converts CSV data into structured JSON format for easy manipulation
- Maintains data integrity throughout the transformation process
- Provides paginated display for efficient handling of large datasets

### Future ETL Capabilities (Extensible Framework)

The application is designed as an extensible platform for advanced ETL operations:
- **Data Cleaning Tools**: Framework ready for implementing data deduplication, normalization, and cleansing operations
- **Column Selection & Filtering**: Infrastructure for advanced column manipulation and selective data processing
- **Export Capabilities**: Prepared for multiple output format support (JSON, XML, processed CSV)
- **Batch Processing**: Architecture supports future implementation of bulk file processing
- **Custom Transformations**: Plugin-ready system for implementing custom data transformation rules
